🦠 CORD-19 Data Exploration & Streamlit App
📌 Overview

This project provides a beginner-friendly workflow for analyzing the CORD-19 research dataset. It covers the entire data science pipeline — from loading and cleaning data to basic analysis, visualization, and deployment of an interactive Streamlit app.

The dataset contains metadata on COVID-19 research papers, including titles, abstracts, publication dates, journals, authors, and source information.

🔗 Dataset: CORD-19 Research Challenge (Kaggle)

🎯 Learning Objectives
